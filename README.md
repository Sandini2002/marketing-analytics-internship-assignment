# 📊 Customer Analytics – Take-Home Assignment

**Candidate:** Sandini Fernando
**Role:** Marketing & Analytics Internship (2026)

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This repository contains my take-home assignment for the **Marketing & Analytics Internship (2026)**.

The objective of this project was to explore customer and sales data, perform basic customer segmentation, analyze sales performance, and communicate insights in a clear and business-friendly way. The focus was on practical analysis, clarity of thinking, and business relevance, rather than complex modeling.

### 📈 Data Summary
The analysis is based on three key datasets processed during the exploration phase:
* **Customers:** 5,000 unique customer profiles (Demographics, Location, Registration Date).
* **Transactions:** 23,814 purchase records (Sales, Order Status, Payment Methods).
* **Products:** 200 unique SKUs (Categories, Pricing, Stock Levels).

## ▶️ How to Run the Analysis

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Open the notebook** located in the `notebook/` folder:
* `customer_analytics_analysis.ipynb`


3. **Ensure the CSV files** (`customers.csv`, `products.csv`, `transactions.csv`) are located in the `data/` folder as shown in the structure above.
4. **Run the notebook cells** from top to bottom.

The notebook performs the following steps sequentially:

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning:** Handling missing values (e.g., customer age, product ratings) and data typing.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creating metrics like *Total Spend*, *Order Frequency*, and *Recency*.
3. **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers to identify high-value segments.
4. **Sales Analysis:** Visualizing trends and performance.

*All outputs and charts are generated directly within the notebook.*
